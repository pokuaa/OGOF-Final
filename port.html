<h2><strong>Learning Opportunities </strong></h2>
<p>Working as a team has allowed us to see the successes and failures of others in a supportive environment.More than that,
 working as a team has also enabled us to learn from each other without undue risk.For example, when things go awry, the team 
 can pull together to make them better. But in the process, everyone learns what not to do next time. That can provide insight
 into how to get things done more effectively the first time around.<br><br>
 
 Being a part of this year’s YAAW has been  so amazing. I didn’t know a thing about web development but now I’m getting a hand at it.<br>
 I would like to encourage everyone to be a part of this amazing family and it would be life changing.<strong>Jessica shares her experience</strong><br><br>
 
 It has been great since I became a part of the YAAW family. This family did not only teach me how to code, <br>
 it also thought me how to socialize. I have learnt a lot from YAAW and am grateful <strong>Thessy cannot hide her excitement</strong><br><br>
 
 Joining YAA W has been a  captivating experience  especially with my interest in Technology but, unsure where and how to start,<br> 
 YAA W has exposed me to avenues that has contributed greatly to developing myself personally and also taught me a lot in relation to web design and development.<br>
 For a Procurement student with no experience in web development, the 2020 Our Girls' Our Future cohort has now equipped me with the necessary skills needed to lunch <br>
 a simple article using the Edpresso platform, how to code among others. I believe there is still more to learn in order to rise up the ladder of web developers and technology gurus.<br>
 I encourage other young women to apply to be a part of this family as it would not only equip them with Tech and Finance skills but also build their confidence levels. <strong>Ruth exclaims</strong><br><br>
 
 
 Working with all these brilliant ladies from different disciplinaries is indeed a blessing. I have learnt soo much from my network. YaaW made your summer awesome <strong>Says Richida</strong><br><br>
